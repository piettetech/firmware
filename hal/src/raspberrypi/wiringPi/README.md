WiringPi README
===============

WiringPi is a GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835 used in the Raspberry Pi. It’s released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and is usable from C and C++ and many other languages with suitable wrappers. It’s designed to be familiar to people who have used the Arduino “wiring” system.

See <http://wiringpi.com/> for more information about WiringPi.

WiringPi has been slightly modified to compile inside the Particle firmware. Thanks Gordon Henderson and all WiringPi contributors for your fantastic open-source work!
